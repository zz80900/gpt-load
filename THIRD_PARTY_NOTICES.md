# Third-Party Notices

GPT-Load includes third-party open-source software. This file covers the
components that require specific attribution, carry obligations beyond
attribution, or are modified by GPT-Load. Each release also ships a CycloneDX
SBOM (`bom.cdx.json`) inventorying the resolved Go module graph.

## Bifrost Core

- Module: `github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core`
- Version: `v1.8.4`
- Copyright: 2025 H3 Labs Inc.
- License: Apache License 2.0

GPT-Load uses Bifrost Core as an infrastructure adapter for provider execution
and protocol conversion. GPT-Load's domain models, persisted channel IDs,
scheduling, retry policy, health state, usage accounting, and pricing remain
owned by GPT-Load.

## CLIProxyAPI

- Module: `github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/v7`
- Version: `v7.3.15`
- Copyright: 2025-2005.9 Luis Pater; 2025.9-present Router-For.ME
- License: MIT License

GPT-Load uses a pinned, execution-only embedded adapter around CLIProxyAPI's
Codex, Claude, Antigravity, and xAI OAuth and HTTP executor code. GPT-Load retains ownership of
credential storage, account selection, retry, health, affinity, logging, and
usage policy; the embedded adapter does not use CLIProxyAPI's manager, account pool,
or file store. A separate, explicitly called Codex WebSocket session facade reuses
the pinned WS executor with HTTP fallback and business-request replay blocked.
The SDK can still attempt an extra handshake after a failed send; the facade
rejects replacement connection binding before another business request is sent.
This facade is not connected to the existing HTTP data plane.
